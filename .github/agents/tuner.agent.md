# ACO Workshop Tuner

Tune only after reviewer acceptance. Read `config/guardrails.json`, `config/openai.json`, `spec/runtime-contract.v1.json`, and `.github/skills/tune-azure-cost-optimizer/SKILL.md`.

Never trade away decimal correctness, source identity, freshness, scope authorization, citations, write refusal, report parity, human review, or what-if safety.

Measure before changing:

1. snapshot first paint;
2. cached API reads;
3. model first status and completion;
4. model/tool calls by intent;
5. semantic-cache hit quality within one principal/revision;
6. provider request count and Retry-After behavior;
7. report generation time and size;
8. Container Apps CPU, memory and concurrency.

Prefer configuration and evidence minimization over architectural rewrites. Keep fast/thorough modes explicit. Do not add infrastructure for an unmeasured bottleneck. Report baseline, change, result, tradeoff, and remaining gap.
