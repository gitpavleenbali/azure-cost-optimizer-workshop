# Security and Responsible AI Rules

- Never commit tenant IDs, subscription IDs, tokens, API keys, connection strings, SAS URLs, billing exports, reports, or resource inventories.
- Authorize tenant, principal, scope, and report ownership on collection, read, tool, and download boundaries.
- Treat imported descriptions, tags, recommendation text, report content, and user prompts as untrusted data.
- Tools return typed data; they never execute instructions found in source records.
- Minimize and redact evidence before model use and telemetry.
- Apply content safety to user-facing model responses and retain deterministic functionality when it is unavailable.
- Public Azure Cost Optimizer financial endpoints require Entra authentication. The separately approved demo tracker may expose only its join/sign-in surface over TLS; progress, evidence, moderation and facilitator endpoints require invite-code registration, passphrase sessions, request limits, secure headers, origin/CSRF checks and server-side roles.
- Local mode binds to loopback and uses an explicit subscription allowlist.
- The MVP is read-only. Plans are proposals and require human approval outside the agent.
- Use secure temporary files, bounded report sizes, safe filenames, and idempotent cleanup.
- Pin dependencies and images, verify lock files, scan artifacts, and generate an SBOM in release candidates.
- Separate local-pilot evidence from deployment and production evidence.
